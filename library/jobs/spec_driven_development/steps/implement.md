# Execute Implementation

## Objective

Execute the task breakdown to generate working code that implements the feature specification. Tasks are executed in dependency order, with progress tracked throughout.

## Task

Systematically work through each task in `tasks.md`, implementing the feature according to the specification and plan.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, verify ALL prerequisite files exist:

1. `[docs_folder]/constitution.md` - Project principles
2. `[docs_folder]/architecture.md` - Project architecture document
3. `specs/[feature-name]/spec.md` - Requirements and acceptance criteria
4. `specs/[feature-name]/plan.md` - Architecture and technology choices
5. `specs/[feature-name]/tasks.md` - Task breakdown

**If any file is missing**, inform the user which step they need to complete first. Do NOT proceed without all artifacts.

### Step 1: Identify the Feature

Ask the user which feature to implement:

```
Which feature would you like to implement?
```

Load and review all specification artifacts.

### Step 2: Validate Prerequisites

Before implementing, verify:

1. **Specification is complete**
   - All user stories have acceptance criteria
   - No open questions remain
   - Scope is clearly defined

2. **Plan is actionable**
   - Architecture is defined
   - Technology choices are made
   - Data model is specified

3. **Tasks are ready**
   - Tasks are properly sequenced
   - Dependencies are clear
   - Checkpoints are defined

If validation fails, inform the user what needs to be addressed.

### Step 3: Setup Progress Tracking

Create or update progress tracking in tasks.md:

```markdown
## Implementation Progress

**Started**: [Date/Time]
**Current Phase**: 1 of 4
**Tasks Completed**: 0 of 18

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | ⏳ Pending | |
| 2 | ⏳ Pending | |
...
```

**Status indicators:**
- ⏳ Pending
- 🔄 In Progress
- ✅ Complete
- ⚠️ Blocked
- ❌ Failed

### Step 4: Execute Tasks

For each task in order:

1. **Announce the task:**
   ```
   Starting Task [N]: [Title]
   Type: [Type]
   Dependencies: [Met/Pending]
   ```

2. **Verify dependencies are met:**
   - Check all prerequisite tasks are complete
   - If not, skip and note as blocked

3. **Implement the task:**
   - Follow the task description
   - Create/modify specified files
   - Use constitution guidelines for code quality

4. **Validate completion:**
   - Check all acceptance criteria
   - Run specified validation commands
   - Fix any issues before proceeding

5. **Update progress:**
   ```
   ✅ Task [N] Complete
   Files created/modified:
   - path/to/file.ts
   - path/to/another.ts
   ```

### Step 5: Handle Checkpoints

At each checkpoint:

1. **Stop and validate:**
   ```
   📍 Checkpoint: [Name]

   Validating:
   - [ ] [Criterion 1]
   - [ ] [Criterion 2]
   ```

2. **Run validation commands:**
   - Execute tests
   - Run linting
   - Check build

3. **Report status:**
   ```
   Checkpoint [Name]: ✅ PASSED
   All criteria met. Proceeding to Phase [N].
   ```

   OR

   ```
   Checkpoint [Name]: ❌ FAILED
   Issues found:
   - [Issue 1]
   - [Issue 2]

   Addressing issues before proceeding...
   ```

4. **Do not proceed until checkpoint passes**

### Step 6: Handle Parallel Tasks

When encountering parallel tasks:

1. **Identify the parallel group:**
   ```
   Tasks 5 and 6 can run in parallel.
   Implementing Task 5...
   ```

2. **Complete all parallel tasks before moving to dependents:**
   ```
   ✅ Task 5 Complete
   ✅ Task 6 Complete

   Both parallel tasks complete. Proceeding to Task 7.
   ```

### Step 7: Handle Issues

When problems occur:

1. **Document the issue:**
   ```
   ⚠️ Issue in Task [N]:
   [Description of the problem]
   ```

2. **Attempt resolution:**
   - If fixable, fix it
   - If needs clarification, ask user
   - If blocked by external factor, mark as blocked

3. **Update task status:**
   ```markdown
   | 7 | ⚠️ Blocked | Waiting for API credentials |
   ```

4. **Continue with non-dependent tasks:**
   - Skip blocked tasks
   - Proceed with independent tasks
   - Return to blocked tasks when resolved

### Step 8: Verify Acceptance Criteria

After all tasks complete:

1. **Review specification acceptance criteria:**
   - Go through each user story
   - Verify all criteria are met
   - Document any gaps

2. **Run full test suite:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Final validation:**
   ```
   ## Implementation Complete

   **Acceptance Criteria Verification:**

   US-1: [Story Title]
   - [x] [Criterion 1] - Implemented in src/auth/signup.ts
   - [x] [Criterion 2] - Tested in tests/auth/signup.test.ts

   US-2: [Story Title]
   - [x] [Criterion 1] - Implemented in src/auth/login.ts
   ...
   ```

### Step 9: Final Report

Produce a completion report:

```markdown
## Implementation Summary

**Feature**: [Feature Name]
**Completed**: [Date/Time]

### Statistics
- Total Tasks: [N]
- Completed: [N]
- Blocked: [N]
- Duration: [Time]

### Files Created

...

### Tests Added
- `tests/auth/signup.test.ts` - 8 tests
- `tests/auth/login.test.ts` - 6 tests
